# Sub_seasonal_climate_forecast

prediction task involving forecasting sub-seasonal temperatures (temperatures over a two-week period, in our case) within the United States. We are using a pre-prepared dataset consisting of weather and climate information for a number of US locations, for a number of start dates for the two-week observation, as well as the forecasted temperature and precipitation from a number of weather forecast models.

Data Dictionary

Temperature: Daily maximum and minimum temperature measurements at 2 meters from 1979 onwards were obtained from NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Global Gridded Temperature dataset and converted to Celsius. The official contest target temperature variable is tmp2m = tmax+tmin / 2.

Global precipitation: Daily precipitation data from 1979 onward were obtained from NOAA’s CPC Gauge-Based Analysis of Global Daily Precipitation [42] and converted to mm.

U.S. precipitation: Daily U.S. precipitation data in mm were collected from the CPC Unified Gauge-Based Analysis of Daily Precipitation over CONUS. Measurements were replaced with sums over the ensuing two-week period.

Sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration: NOAA’s Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (SST) dataset provides SST and sea ice concentration data, daily from 1981 to the present.

Multivariate ENSO index (MEI): Bimonthly MEI values (MEI) from 1949 to the present, were obtained from NOAA/Earth System Research Laboratory. The MEI is a scalar summary of six variables (sea-level pressure, zonal and meridional surface wind components, SST, surface air temperature, and sky cloudiness) associated with El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), an ocean-atmosphere coupled climate mode.

Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO): Daily MJO values since 1974 are provided by the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology. MJO is a metric of tropical convection on daily to weekly timescales and can have a significant impact on the United States sub-seasonal climate. Measurements of phase and amplitude on the target date were extracted over the two-week period.

Relative humidity, sea level pressure, and precipitable water for the entire atmosphere: NOAA’s National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/National Center for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis dataset contains daily relative humidity (rhum) near the surface (sigma level 0.995) from 1948 to the present and daily pressure at the surface (pres) from 1979 to the present.

Geopotential height, zonal wind, and longitudinal wind: To capture polar vortex variability, obtained daily mean geopotential height were obtained at 10mb from the NCEP Reanalysis dataset.

North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME): The North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) is a collection of physics-based forecast models from various modeling centers in North America. Forecasts issued monthly from the Cansips, CanCM3, CanCM4, CCSM3, CCSM4, GFDL-CM2.1-aer04, GFDL-CM2.5, FLOR-A06 and FLOR-B01, NASA-GMAO-062012, and NCEP-CFSv2 models were downloaded from the IRI/LDEO Climate Data Library. Each forecast contains monthly mean predictions from 0.5 to 8.5 months ahead.

Variable naming
Each variable name, prefix__suffix, consists of two parts (separated by a double underscore) that inform you of the meaning of the variable. The prefix indicates from which of the above-listed file the variable was derived (e.g. Madden-Julian oscillation, pressure, and potential evaporation from NOAA's surface_gauss etc), the suffix indicates the specific type of information that was extracted from the file.
